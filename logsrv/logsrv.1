.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the kludge log server. It accepts log messages over a TCP
connection; clients should use the logsrvc package to make sure
log messages are properly formatted for entry in the database.
On startup,
.Nm
scans the database to make sure the tables exist and the schemas
are up to date. If the schema is out of sync, the table is dropped
and recreated. This will cause the log server to lose all log
entries in that table. Before upgrading, the database should be
backed up.
.Sh OPTIONS

a single thread that writes to the database file to prevent
corruption on the SQLite database.
.It Fl f Ar database
specify the path to the SQLite database. If it doesn't exist, it
will be created.
.It Fl p Ar port
specify the TCP to listen for log messages on.
